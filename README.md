## Sketches made with Processing

These are a few sample sketches I wrote while playing around with Processing in undergrad. Below is a description of each:

- Trapped is a simple animation in which a block is trapped inside the visible canvas. If is in eternal motion and keeps bouncing back fromthe edges of the canvas.

Note: These were made a few years back(Apr 2011) with Processing 1.5 beta and hence might require changes to run in the latest version.
